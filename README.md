## Other Stories / Epics that would be worth doing
- As myself, I would like an Angular Application that will demonstrate a web appliction that exposes the same interface as the Wpf application and communicates through the API so that I can demonstrate javascript patterns 
- As a tester, I want the "Rebuild Database" command exposed through the API so I can wrap that functionality in a test
- As myself, I would like to optionally use the API for communication from the WPF application so that I can demonstrate N-Tier functionality
- As myself, I would like to implement NLog throughout the application so that I can demonstrate logging patterns
- As myself, I would like to implement better try/catch/finally exception handling throughout the application so that I can gracefully handle, log, and report exceptions to the User
- As a tester, I would like to enhance the postman script so that it can be run as a suite where each step interacts with one another and I can demonstrate a full unit of work
- As myself, I would like to use the new GitHub CI-CD features so that I can execute tests and build on GitHub
- As a User, I would like to refine the test data generated by the repository so the entries are not dumb.
- As a User, I would like to be prompted for a Description when adding a new Item so that every new item isn't initally defined as "New Item"
- As a User, I would like to remove the border from the WPF application and add a custom control box so that it presents better
- As a tester, I would like to improve test coverage to > 80% overall so that I can better ensure quality
